The aim of this application was to produce estimates automatically and then generate contracts that are synchronised via the existing CRM API. Today, the application generates an average of 400 contracts per month. It also enables the technical teams to manage their appointments with a single click when they arrive at the customer's premises, and for the customer to sign off on the application when they leave.",
